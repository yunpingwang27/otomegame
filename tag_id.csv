513,Netorare,0.6666666666666666,"This visual novel has scenes focused on Netorare. Netorare is more than a simple act of infidelity, but the fetishization of jealousy and other negative feelings commonly associated with it.      For a game to be classified as Netorare the following conditions must be met:      1. The protagonist's significant other, a very close friend, or in some cases, a close relative is stolen from him by someone seducing, coercing, blackmailing, outright raping them, or by using other techniques. It doesn't necessarily mean that they are literally stolen, but the negative feelings experienced by their significant other might make it seem so.      2. The one who loses their loved one almost always finds out about the situation and suffers from jealousy and the feeling of helplessness arisen from an inability to change anything. The one stealing the lover and/or the stolen loved one might rub it in by humiliating the loser in private or in public.      3. The trait does [b]not[/b] apply if the character having sex with someone else does not have a close loving relationship with the protagonist, and if the protagonist does not experience jealousy and other negative feelings upon finding out about the act. In other words, the ties between the partners and their forcible separation is important to the netorare fetish. For example, an unrequited crush or a potential hero(ine) on a different route would not count for the purposes of this fetish.      4. The act of stealing must happen while the protagonist is in a relationship with the stolen significant other. Scenes of heroine's past relationships do not count as Netorare.      The game is usually portrayed from the perspective of someone losing his significant other, in order to delve deep into the jealousy aspect of the fetish, however, for story purposes the game might switch between multiple POVs and also portray the events from the perspective of the stolen SO."
514,Netori,1.0,"Netori is a counterpart tag to [url=/g513]Netorare[/url], however instead of playing as someone who has his significant lover stolen, you play as the one doing the stealing.      Rather than fetishizing jealousy and other negative feelings, Netori is a power trip of pulling one over another person and taking something that is theirs.      For a game to be classified as Netori, the following conditions must be met:      1. The protagonist steals the significant other, a very close friend, or in extremely rare cases, a close relative from another character by seducing, coercing, blackmailing, outright raping them, or by using other techniques.      2. The character stolen must be someone you are not supposed to steal. As an example, the protagonist having sex with someone's mother wouldn't be Netori, if she doesn't have a significant other. However, it would become Netori if she is the protagonist's own mother, and the father is present in the game in some form.      3. For Netori-themed games the finding out aspect is less important, as the game focuses on the protagonist and his conquest. Still, the losing character needs to exist within the game and play some role related to his SO being stolen. If the losing character does not appear or is barely mentioned, the game should be tagged with [url=/g1380]Infidelity[/url] instead of Netori.      4. The trait does not apply if the protagonist's conquest does not have a close loving relationship with another character, as ties between the partners and their forcible separation by the protagonist is important aspect of the fetish."

Event CG description from [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel]Wikipedia[/url]:   In the typical visual novel, the graphics comprise a set of generic backgrounds (normally just one for each location in the game), with character sprites (立ち絵 , tachi-e) superimposed on these; the perspective is usually first-person, with the protagonist remaining unseen. At certain key moments in the plot, special event CG graphics are displayed instead; these are more detailed images, drawn specially for that scene rather than being composed from predefined elements, which often use more cinematic camera angles and include the protagonist. These event CGs can usually be viewed at any time once they have been ""unlocked"" by finding them in-game; this provides a motivation to replay the game and try making different decisions, as it is normally impossible to view all special events on a single play-through."

823,Infinite Spontaneous Power-ups,0.0,"Similar to its parent-tag with the exception that these powering-up situations occur multiple times in a single combat.      Battles/conflicts in the game tend to be solved, rather than by skill, wit, equipment or pre-existing factors, by willpower or such, allowing characters to pass their limits as many times higher and higher as the situation requires.   A mortal blow is not the end, it's a chance to power up to infinity. Typically anger and proximity (or actuality) of death only strengthen the characters, allowing them to draw out unfathomable power.   Battles employing this plot device can typically always end either way, since there are objectively virtually no restrictions on the number of times you can power up with yet another attack more powerful than the last one you took.      For example:   As the hero gets beaten by the story's archvillain, he remembers a move his kung fu master taught him and uses it to take down his adversary.   The archvillain, baffled by this situation, gets angrier and turns into a demon which in turn beats down the hero.   Hero gets a sudden blessing from his dead-childhood-friend-turn-angel and blasts the demon with holy fire.   In response to that the demon-archvillain grabs a mecha, that was conveniently lying where he fell (or summons one out of thin air), and fuses with it to become an archvillain-demon-mecha and disintegrates the hero with laser beams.   Following this the hero has a long scene about his past, friends, family, etc., which somehow renews his will and rouses him back from the dead as a super-human-angel-blessed-kung-fu guy and...

It differs from sadism in that it is a voyeuristic fantasy fetish with focus towards fictional characters from video games, anime, comics, TV and movies that include battering, abusing or otherwise killing women. Characters from movies and TV series represented by live actresses are becoming more common as less stigmatism is attached to violence being inflicted to women in media. Because the fetish is so broad it often incorporates other, more common, fetishes such as humiliation, rape, and BDSM depending on the preference of the individual. Often the victim is any combination of physically fit, well trained, or strong of will as many find ryona more appealing the greater the gap between the victim and offender's usual power.      In case the victim is male it is often labeled as gyaku-ryona. Fairly popular among females, and even some males especially when the assailant is a female.

For example, they may often retort at the comical misunderstandings of the other characters.      Similar in execution to the concepts of ""funny man"" and ""straight man"" in double act comedy, boke and tsukkomi are a very important characteristic of manzai (Japanese style of comedy).

They do not need to be the tsukkomi in a real comedy duo. They just need to act like a tsukkomi in their everyday life and interact with characters displaying boke traits. For example, they may often retort at the comical misunderstandings of the other characters.      Similar in execution to the concepts of ""funny man"" and ""straight man"" in double act comedy, boke and tsukkomi are a very important characteristic of manzai (Japanese style of comedy). Boke comes from the verb bokeru which carries the meaning of ""senility"" or ""air headed-ness"" and is reflected in the boke's tendency for misinterpretation and forgetfulness. The word tsukkomi refers to the role the second comedian plays in ""butting in"" and correcting the boke's errors. In performances it is common for the tsukkomi to berate the boke and hit them on the head with a swift smack; one traditional manzai prop often used for this purpose is a pleated paper fan.

Forced prostitution, also known as involuntary prostitution is a classical form of this form of sexual slavery, wherein sex traffickers force victims to become prostitutes or work in the sex industry.   This various work in the sex industry includes prostitution, dancing in strip clubs, performing in pornographic films and pornography, and other forms of involuntary servitude.      IMPORTANT NOTE: Non-consensual sexual slavery starts out as non-consensual and stays that way. The victim doesn't go through mindbreak and doesn't become a willing slave at any point in the story."
1823,Sexual Slavery (Choukyou Variation),1.9999999999999998,"This is an ambiguous merging of the non-consensual and the consensual form of sexual slavery, which is often depicted within nukige.   Although some means of force is applied to some unwilling people like in non-consensual sexual slavery, the border to consensual slavery is blurry to the most.      In the exaggeration of this medium, the unwillingness transforms rather instantly by means of sexual stimulation to a (semi-)consensual form.   This unnatural behaviour of characters is pure fictitious and one feature of nukige.   Further, this depiction of sexual slavery borrows regularly the symbols by which a consensual submission is demonstrated of the submissive to others indicating the belonging to the dominant, such as wearing a collar, special tattoos, piercings, a very short haircut or a bald head.      Therefore, a nukige with sexual slavery as theme defies often a clear classification into one of the two real life forms of sexual slavery.      IMPORTANT NOTE: This variation of sexual slavery starts out as non consensual and either turns consensual by bringing out the victim's inner masochist or mindbreak erases most of the victim's original personality to the point, where one cannot really talk about ""will"" and ""consensuality""."

Microtransactions are a game mechanic in which a player can buy content within the game with real money. Microtransactions are extremely common in ""free-to-play"" games, leading to the term ""freemium"" to describe them. They are most often found in games on mobile platforms, but are not exclusive to them.      Rather than paying for content directly, games with microtransactions often require the player to buy amounts of a ""premium"" currency, which is then exchanged for the content that they want.      In visual novels, microtransactions can be implemented in any or all of the following ways (this list is not exhaustive):      1. The player can only read a certain amount of the VN in a single day, but can pay to read more. This is often represented by a ""tickets"" system in VNs, or a ""stamina"" or ""energy"" gauge in other types of games.      2. When the player comes to a choice point, the ""best"" choice requires the player to pay to select it. This may simply unlock a CG or may be required for a good ending.      3. The player can use money/premium currency to draw random content (side stories, game items, game currency, etc) from a pool. Use g2711 for games that include this mechanic.      Do not use this tag for games which have a free prologue then allow you to buy individual routes (these are functionally identical to a demo and a paid game) or for games which have paid side stories or similar bonus content (these are just normal DLC) unless they also contain another type of microtransaction mechanic."

3212,Flat Tints Only,24.833333333333336,"This VN has CG or tachie (sprites) whose base shading uses flat tints exclusively, in opposition to gradation.   A flat tint is a coat of water color of one uniform shade when a [url=https://uigradients.com/#Relaxingred]gradation[/url] is a gradual or barely perceptible change from one tone or shade, as of color, to another.   This applies to tachie and event CG, not to backgrounds (usually drawn by a different artist and which can use a totally different art style).   Both techniques can be used in conjunction in a single CG/tachie but they must not use this tag.      Example of flat tints only:   https://s.vndb.org/sf/77/33177.jpg   https://s.vndb.org/sf/04/19104.jpg (this one is animated, which explain why this kind of shading is used and why Anime-like shading is an alias of this tag)      Example of gradation (pretty much every VN):   https://s.vndb.org/sf/13/7413.jpg   https://s.vndb.org/sf/14/59814.jpg      An example and counter-example (with the skin) using PC98 assets:   [url=https://s.vndb.org/sf/38/31138.jpg]Kuro no Danshou[/url]   [url=https://s.vndb.org/sf/99/82199.jpg]Toumei Ningen[/url]      Graphical effects and filters added to the base shading can be applied on a CG and alter the flat tints to the point it adds little gradation to it but it doesn't discard the VN from being tagged as long as the base shading is made of flat tints.   Examples of graphical effects are steam (for onsen events), blurring (for focus), sunset effect, etc. An example of filter would be a ""dazzling"" filter.      Two examples taken from the same visual novel, [url=/v18580]Aoiro Note[/url]:      [url=https://s.vndb.org/sf/79/33179.jpg]Graphical sunset effect[/url].   It adds, from a single point, the sun behind the glass, more light to the base shading with the purpose of making the CG dazzling.      [url=https://s.vndb.org/sf/41/105541.jpg]Example of ""dazzling"" filter[/url].   It makes the whole erotic scene looks like it was taken from a phantasm even though it doesn't have extra light source like it was the case with the previous example.

3495,Bimbofication,0.0,"This visual novel features character(s) that are subjected to bimbofication. Bimbofication is a type of [url=/g3105]Sexual Corruption[/url], which results in the character becoming a [url=/i3547]Bimbo[/url]. The affected character is usually initially described as innocent/prude, smart, diligent, or simply unassuming, however the circumstances align to turn them into an oversexed sexpot, usually known as a [url=/i3547]Bimbo[/url]. The usual changes experienced by the character are these:      1. Looks: Character starts dressing in revealing and eye-catching clothing, wear gaudy make-up and lots of fashion accessories, dye their hair (blonde colour dominates, but other variations are possible). Frequently bimbos employ plastic surgery to enhance their looks. Tattoos and piercing are also occasionally proudly displayed.      2. Outlook: The character starts craving hedonistic activities and frequently participates in parties and other social gatherings. They usually become sexually [url=/g1667]promiscuous[/url] and start having sex with multiple partners. They might even get involved in sex work.      3. Intelligence: In fantasy/sci-fi settings the character usually is subjected to mental degradation that somehow decreases their intelligence. In real world setting, the character reprioritizes their lifestyle, usually dropping out of school, retiring from work, in order to seek a more hedonistic and social lifestyle. Drug use and abuse is also pretty common in such works.      A particular variation of the trope present in Japan is Gyarufication (and by extension Gangurofication), where a normal high school girl (or a young woman) usually falls in with a bad crowd, and over the course of the game starts displaying looks and attitude associated with the negative [url=/i1219]Gyaru[/url] / [url=/i1054]Ganguro[/url] stereotypes. The usual bimbo tropes of changing the looks, becoming morally lax, seeking hedonistic activities and sex, and not caring about studies or work tend to apply. Their lifestyle tends to be costly and will often lead to enjo-kousai and prostitution.

Similar in execution to the concepts of ""funny man"" and ""straight man"" in double act comedy, boke and tsukkomi are a very important characteristic of manzai (Japanese style of comedy). Boke comes from the verb bokeru which carries the meaning of ""senility"" or ""air headed-ness"" and is reflected in the boke's tendency for misinterpretation and forgetfulness. The word tsukkomi refers to the role the second comedian plays in ""butting in"" and correcting the boke's errors. In performances it is common for the tsukkomi to berate the boke and hit them on the head with a swift smack; one traditional manzai prop often used for this purpose is a pleated paper fan.

Usually player should decide on his own what to do next, where to go, what events to do in what order.      Main characteristics of the genre are a calendar (i.e. time management), map movement, various resources and statistics you need to gather and level up, repeatable events which often can have various upgrades/continuations depending on how many times you did them before, new unlockable events depending on various conditions etc.      A key difference from pure [url=/g39]Dating Simulation[/url] or [url=/g40]Raising Simulation[/url] games is that the sandbox is not necessarily about dates/romance, and various parameters you need to level up are not focused exclusively on a protagonist or on other characters, though elements of those genres may be present.
