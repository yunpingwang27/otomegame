As a result, your father secretly asked the royal doctor Sieg to create a clone of your brother. On the night of the accident, Sieg informed you of the clone and the problem with him – he was like a blank piece of paper, with neither memory nor personality. The only good thing about him was the fact that he had the potential to grow up. Since the king and queen already passed away, the responsibility of educating your new "brother" rested on your shoulder.

She quits her job at the factory and starts looking for a new job. That’s when she bumpes into Egawa Chitomi and Arita Kisuke, who are looking for a new maid for the Miyanomori family. Haru applied for the job on the spot, leaving her hometown to work in their mansion in Tokyo. She thought working as a maid would be fun.. until she meets the six Miyanomori brothers.		The brothers each have different mothers, all divorced from their father — the head of the family, Miyanomori Genichirou. Being born in a big family, most of the brothers treat Haru like crap.

Haru quickly realized that her new job isn’t by any means easy, but she needs to work hard for her family.		Not too long after Haru starts working there, Genichirou announced to his sons that he’s retiring soon and he’s making a game to determine who will be the next head. The brothers have to entertain him and collect points. The first one who reached ten points will be the new head, and they have until March to please their father. This is the reason why the brothers all have different mothers: Genichirou wants to put them into a battle for the position.

One day her mother asks them to clean their warehouse, where they find a silver mirror among the other antique stuff. Just before they go out, a thunder strikes outside and Aoi gets absorbed into the mirror. When she opens her eyes Aoi finds herself back in 1873, the Meiji era... and in front of her is a group of travelling performers, Aoiza.		Aoi immediately notices an older Sousuke in the group, but he introduces herself as Kaminari Kensuke and tells her she’s got the wrong person. For some reason the group also keeps calling her “Futaba Aoi”, making her even more confused. She follows Aoiza back to their headquarter, a shop called Miyoshino in Ueno, where she finally learns that “Futaba Aoi” is actually a sacred stone they’ve been protecting all this time. It’s a family crest with a strong magical power, but nobody knows of its existence except for Aoiza’s members. Today the stone suddenly disappeared from its box, and they finally found it on Aoi’s wrist. Because of this, they now think she’s the embodiment of “Futaba Aoi” itself.	As for Aoi herself, she was born holding that stone. Her grandma said it might bring good luck to her someday, so Aoi keeps it with her all the time. Who would have thought that it’s going to play an important role in the past? The Aoiza members then asks her to stay with them, since she doesn’t know anything about this world. Plus, it would be easier for them to protect the stone as well. Aoi gladly takes their offer, and it marks the start of her journey with them.

11488、Jouen@Christmas -I Can't Live Without You-、None、ja、win、ja、https://s2.vndb.org/cv/49/48249.jpg、Narumi Sakurai is a 3rd year university student with a problem: her crush, Hibiki Sano, completely ignores her! Suffice to say, when her attempt to finally confess goes down the drain once again thanks to Hibiki’s airhead nature she feels kinda irritated. Oh, if only she’d turn into a more honest person! 		But as they say, ‘Be careful what you wish for’. It’ s a lesson Narumi learns the hard way when the thing she picks up on the street that looks like a genie lamp…actually has a young man in an Arabian outfit appear before her, offering to grant 3 wishes. Already being annoyed from her failure, without thinking she demands for him to make her into a ‘girl that’s honest about the feelings in her own heart’. Wish granted, it’s the start of a giant headache. More so when you add Narumi’s childhood friend/yandere shota stalker, Shimizu Ren, into the mix.		Use the 2nd wish to cancel the first one? As if! No way she’d waste it on something like that. With only 3 days as the time limit, she’ll have to think of a way to best use the remaining ones while escaping the embarrassing results of the ‘curse’ that is the 1st one.

It was the usual path home. Suddenly, I then realised I became lost in an unfamiliar street. Next to me was the figure of "Makoto", my childhood friend hurrying on the path home. My mobile was out of range. With no way to go back as there was no path we came from, the fog intensified and all we could do was set on going forwards. After a while, we found a large mansion and a huge, naked cherry blossom tree. Anxiously, we decide to visit, and were answered with--		"Why did you come? I told you not come, didn't I?"		The young man, "Fubuki", glared at us, appearing to be displeased.		Even though we were told not to come, it was pitch black around us and we had no idea how to get home. All Makoto and I could do was borrow a room and stay for the night.		After the night, we left the mansion. We then became enveloped in mist and despaired in the grey scenery. The fog, thick and white, wrapped our surroundings, and the forest that extended to the large garden was very dense...	The Hanamo-machi we lived in... was nowhere to be found.	This place isn't the world as I know it.		"Welcome to Hanari."		It was the residents of the mansion that welcomed us.	The ones who welcomed us were - "Taruhi", "Hinata" and "Kirishima".	In the garden was a lifeless cherry blossom tree. Gradually, it made me remember being spirited away.	The shadow of the one that took my hand.	And, the voice that said "Come", and the voice that said "Don't come".		I got cursed.	They said I could go by in this mysterious world without care, but unrelentingly, they pressed me to make an ultimate choice.	There is no right answer anywhere, but they said I can only make one choice.		If so...	If you'll take my hand, if you choose me, if you're destined to not be able to live without me...		"I will give it to you, anything and everything."		[Translation of the official website's story]、1.0、

During my first year, I didn’t join any clubs, made a decent effort with my studies, and somehow managed to get by the year being swept away by my surroundings in a daze. But I’m definitely saying no to spending a mediocre high school life until graduation. I want to be like everyone else, joining clubs, doing part-time jobs, and having hobbies. I want to challenge myself to find something that I can give my all to. And most importantly…. I want to fall in love!		I heard this from my friend, and it piqued my interest, the jinx that circled around Haruhino High School. If you two watch the fireworks from the ‘Asumigaoka’ that overlooks the street below, and share a kiss together, then your love will last forever.		Can I fulfill this with the person I love too?

When the 14-years-old protagonist's (Nike) father and mother died, she was taken over by her uncle, Rijurel, who is of a blood-sucking species.

Its name is “Prince Pia Carrot”, which is the “Pia Carrot” family restaurant chain’s ninth store. It’s distinctive among the other Pia Carrot restaurants because all of its employees are male waiters. All of the waiters are handsome, and there are countless female customers that visit just for them.		Prince Pia Carrot’s sole female comes along, employed as a waitress. Her name is Yoshioka Misaki. She came to work for the restaurant in order to compensate for the breakage of the expensive crockery which was planned for store use. After ending up working for the restaurant part-time due to a series of events, Misaki discovers that her coworkers are all individualistic and strange.		The store manager, Kinoshita Kuon… Though soft in demeanour, he’s irresponsible and lazy.		The student council president, Todoroki Arashi. Not only is he eccentric, but he’s constantly causing trouble.		Though intelligent, Suzushiro Shun is apathetic and doesn't really interact with others.		Matoba Daichi is a capable worker, but he’s taciturn and it’s hard to tell what’s on his mind.		On top of that, some of them don’t like the idea of a waitress joining Prince Pia Carrot…		Afterwards, Misaki’s innocent, boyish classmate, Tachibana Kokoro, and the somewhat very sadistic deputy president of her school’s student council, Yamauchi Maito, also become waiters; livening up the place further.

During the turbulent times brought on by the cunning and wicked Sousou, the "Maozoku (cat race)" were removed from their hidden village. They're a race with with the body of a human and ears of a beast, said to be descendants of the cat-shaped youkai known as the "Kinme (golden eyes)". For this reason, the Maozoku are despised by humans. Humans are told of an old legend in which cats are an outcast of the 12 signs of the zodiac. Calling cats "Juuza (13th sign of the zodiac)", the humans scorn them.		Having been caught in the middle of the humans' conflicts, the curse of the Kinme that had been lying within the head of the Maozoku, Ryuubi, gets amplified. As result, Ryuubi became cruel and wicked; hijacking the Enshou Forces and attempting to use them to slaughter thousands upon thousands of humans. However, due to Kan'u and her fellow Maozoku's life-risking efforts, they were able to stop Ryuubi. Thus, Ryuubi returned to his original form of a child, and the curtains close on the Battle of Guandu.		From then on, half a year passes.		Sousou rose in power, dominating the Heibei province with his unrelenting power.

Taking advantage of Sousou's absence, the humans of Kyoto rebelled and brutalised the Maozoku. The Maozoku continued to be on the receiving end of the humans' irrational acts of violence. Unable to retaliate, they were chased out of their village.		In the time of upheaval, the wheels of fate of the Maozoku and the humans were sure to circle once again...

The village is protected by a barrier that the continent's guardian deity has built up.		But one day, the barrier had faded away.		Immediately, a wave of demons attacked. They could fend them off, but the barrier was still gone. During this time, a voice calls for Kagami and she wanders off into the forest. As she arrives at his destination, there's that huge tree where the guardian deity - a black snake - sleeps.		As if it was inviting her, Kagami talks to the guardian:		"Oh, Holy Black Snake..."		As she calls out this name, a man appears from the giant tree.	He tells Kagami she is the reincarnation of the Holy White Snake, the counterpart to the Holy Black Snake.		This turn of events surprises her, however, she is told that, with the divine powers of the Holy White Snake, he could be able to create the barrier again. Kagami instantly becomes fond of the idea and uses her powers to erect one.		However, that barrier is weak and will only last a month.	To create a more potent barrier, the only method that Kagami can come up with, is, if she were to reincarnate as the Holy White Snake.		No matter the cost, she must find another way to create the barrier.		Supported by two childhood friends who know about the ordeal, Kagami is looking for another method. Will she succeed?

The special defence corps, commonly known as the "SS", lead by Jearl Gabriela. The mafia that opposes the SS, known as "Evening Star", lead by Belial de Clan. 		This is a story about the conflict and love which unfolds between the two organisations connected by destiny.		Luciel Evlis (the protagonist), due to her peculiar background, is called "Eve, the one who brings about misfortune". Consequently, she has lived her entire life ostracised by everyone around her.		A certain success came to her, by way of her working to improve her standing in life. Namely, it was earning a scholarship to become a scholarship student cadet in Vace. Vace is a military school which acts like a training facility to enable its students to become SS members. Tuition in Vace is free, due to the country providing it grants. On top of not questioning one's, bloodline or descent, student cadets in leadership positions are guaranteed wages.		In order to secure this guarantee, Luciel worked extremely hard and finally earned the position of a leader cadet. Her joy of being able to work alongside Jearl Gabriela- her superior officer whom she greatly admires- is short-lived as a major happening occurs which changes her life.		The leaders of Evening Star call her "Lucifer".		The devils that speak honeyed words, and the seemingly cool-headed angels. Betrayed by those who she thought she could trust, and on the other hand, loved and waited upon by those who are supposed to be her enemies.		Who will Luciel choose?	The devils who idolise her, or the angels she idolises?		[Translation of the [URL=http://quinrose.com/game/black/story.html]official website's story summary[/URL].]、1.0、

It all happened on August 1st.	The protagonist woke up one morning to discover that she had lost all memory of anything before August 1st. She had no idea who she was, what life she had lead and her relationship with those around her. It was then when a young man who called himself a "spirit" appeared before her.		Him and the protagonist headed for her place of work, "Meido no Hitsuji (Sheep of the Other World)." She proceeds to work whilst covering up the fact that she's an amnesiac.		A few days later...	Plans of the Meido no Hitsuji's upcoming "concept event" gets around. Apparently, the particulars of this event were proposed by the protagonist herself before her memory loss. With no recollection of the event plans, and no knowledge of the details, the protagonist gets started on helping out her colleagues with the preparations...		---		In Amnesia World, the theme is "Parallel Worlds". You're able to choose different "worlds" to play in after the prologue: the "School World", in which you're a normal high school girl, the "Music World", in which you work for a music company, and the "Criminal World", in which you work at a detective agency. Alternatively you can stay in the "Normal World", which is set in the "original" Amnesia world. Each world has a different atmosphere and gameplay.

Because of his passing, the massive debt the company he once lead is left to her. She had no time to grieve. Her mother had passed away when she was a child, so she no longer has any relatives she can rely on. 		When she was completely at a loss, a saviour extended his hand for her to hold...The hand belonged to Shingyouji Souichi, a representative belonging to a large enterprise. He apparently was an old friend of her father's.		Souichi had quickly repaid the debt, started a new business, hired all of the staff from her father's company, and on top of that, officially became Kanako's guardian.		Set to live in the Shingyouji family's main home, Kanako gets picked up by Hayama Tsukasa, who was her father's secretary, and is lead to a location appointed by Souichi. She finds out that it's not the Shingyouji mansion she'll be living in, but in an apartment where his two sons live on their own.		Instructed to cohabitate with the brothers, Kanako felt uneasy. During her unease, Souichi mentions something that kicked her further down...		"Choose one of them to marry. Whoever you choose will take over my company."		Thinking of how much Souichi had done for her and the employees left over by her father's company, she couldn't refuse.		Little by little, not even Kanako herself has realised... that she's slowly being lead into a birdcage...

The protagonist, Fujieda Neri, lived in the poor district within the "Ring Area", which surrounds the Tokyo Bay. She lived a modest, but peaceful lifestyle.

The private Kaikyuu Academy... A prestigious boarding school attended by sons and daughters from privileged families, founded upon the goal of educating them well in order to give them the tools to support future Japan.		Following the letter left by her father, Neri transferred into Kaikyuu Academy, a school where celebrities gather.

At the very top of the social hierarchy is the "Queen", endowed with incredible political influence, she rules over the students.

Finally, there is "The Resistance", which is an organisation composed of students who oppose the social hierarchy system.		In a society far more disparate than she had ever imagined, Neri finds "love", and gradually, a certain "truth" about the academy surfaces. What is this "truth?"

Alice Liddell starts off as lovers, or otherwise, very close to the characters.		She found a place she could call home with her significant other, and remained in the Country of Hearts. All the characters are supposed to be people she knew, but for some reason, the gatekeepers of Boushiya's (Blood Dupre's) mansion were people Alice didn't remember seeing. The gatekeepers, although looking nothing like one another, were twins. One was a narcissist, and the other likes the occult—they don't lose out to the other characters in terms of individuality.		In addition, there is a storm coming that somewhat makes people crazy. The arrival of the "Crazy Storm". It's said that anybody exposed to the Crazy Storm will gradually go "funny". For example, Blood Dupre coming to like coffee, or the Queen of Hearts falling in love with White Rabbit (Peter White) and starting to collect soft toys.		The Crazy Storm is drawing closer to the Country of Hearts.		"Those precious to me will somewhat change."	Shaken by the imminent arrival of the storm, Alice loses her way and ends up in the dreams of the "Strange Egg".		The storm that threatens to make the Country of Hearts go mad, and the egg's dream that perplexes Alice...		In a world where common sense has no bearing, what will happen to the realistic Alice and her love?

Essence integration - a name devised by the process’s creator, Nathan Bayard - revolutionized the world’s view of human life. Although a privilege mainly to the wealthy, the vessels of metal and plastic assured freedom from illness and aging while still allowing the human pleasures of eating, sleeping, and bathing. Not only was the invention groundbreaking, Bayard’s essence androids promised to be a milestone in the history of mankind, a testament to man’s longevity and will not just to survive, but improve…		…until life itself was neatly swept away by something as small as a virus produced by the hands of one man.		Nine months after the first strain of Blight, Alice wakes in a dilapidated laboratory, remembering naught but blood and the world before the virus.

She dreams of becoming a seafaring adventurer, having been influenced by watching church plays, hearing epic heroic tales and learning that her missing father was also an adventurer who crossed the ocean. To fulfill this desire, she leaves the town where she has comfortably lived, and ventures to the port, King’s Bridge.		Shortly after her arrival, she gets caught up in a tussle and ends up acting in unison with pirates. From then on, she grew interested in them. Two methods of being able to go to sea appear before her- one being “pirates”, and the other, the “navy”.		Will she choose to live her life as a pirate aboard their ship; joining the elusive and whimsical crew lead by its chivalrous yet self-centred ore-sama captain and the always calm, cool and collected deputy captain with a scary smile? Or will she join the ranks of the navy; answering to a young-looking naval commanding officer who’s proud of his nobility and the older, taciturn deputy commanding officer who exudes an aura of depth?		Which will the protagonist choose? What kind of adventurer will she become? Who will become the closest partner at her side?		[Translation of the official website's plot summary.]、1.0、

Jet black wings, sharp horns, deep crimson eyes and a sinister carved seal- their appearance could no longer be called human.		Yes… They are not human.	They’re the Four Heavenly Kings, hailing from the netherworld in a different dimension. They have come under the guidance of a book detailing the selection of a devil king, in order to search for a successor.

Things are going swimmingly (except for perhaps her brother’s debt/bootlegging problem and an ominous dream or two,) until a woman comes along asking for a book. Not a library book—that would be too easy—but a book that doesn’t belong in Tetrine’s library. The book turns out to be written in a magical script called Nell marks that only a few people can see, and Tetrine is one of them.		However, all her life she’s been told in no uncertain terms that letting on that she can see the marks is a Bad Idea. Which is unfortunate, because several people, two of whom have suspicious intentions, find out. A kidnapping and an attempted murder (or two) ensues, and Tetrine’s life will never quite be the same again.

She spent her entire freshman year studying her butt off at university, and she’s never really been out partying. At least…not that she can remember. Strange, horrible dreams of feeling her heart and mind slowly freeze solid in an endless black void haunt her long after she’s woken up, and make it hard for her to keep in touch with reality at all, much less get excited about a week of block partying at the ass-end of the country. Not one day into the long drive, however, the group’s van breaks down in the middle of the thickly forested New England mountains. With no help in sight and the sun rapidly setting, the gang seeks shelter in a dilapidated hilltop mansion, marked only with the number “72.”		Her friends are determined to go in, but nearing the estate reminds Dawn of the cold, isolated terror of the dark world in her dreams. It’s not long before her premonitions are proven true, as the group finds a desiccated corpse sitting up in the dining room and far worse surprises in the basement. The would-be spring breakers rush the door and hammer at the windows, but some supernatural force has locked them inside. What’s worse, the assumed house number “72” turns out to be another warning: the number warps and shifts lower every hour, counting down to an unknown fate at the end of their 3-day visit. She doesn’t know it yet, but the lives of her companions are in Dawn’s hands. The people she puts her trust in and the choices she commits to determine who survives the tale, as the house becomes more hostile hour by passing hour. Dawn must learn to fight for what she truly believes before the sun sets on the final day, or the master of this haunted house will claim all the little thieves that have wandered into his maw.

However, her attempts had constantly ended up in failure.		"Maybe I'm not fit to be a teacher?"	As the protagonist thought this and was about to give up, she had finally received a report indicating that she had passed.		Her heart leapt at the thought of her new life as a teacher. The school that had employed her is located in the 48th prefecture of Japan known as the Aima Prefecture, and is a training school designed to educate inexperienced UMA so that they can become fully-fledged UMA.		In fact, Koyomi had accidentally undertaken the "animal trainer" employment exam instead of the "teacher" exam!		"This is impossible for me," said Koyomi, as she was about to decline her offer of employment.	In response to this, the school's principal promised, "if you can can work admirably for us for one year, I'll put in a good word for you to other high schools."		Having no experience whatsoever in the art of training, will Koyomi be able to train an UMA?		Also, will she be able to assist in the growth of an inexperienced UMA into an excellent one?		For the sake of being able to transfer to a different high school- though filled with her doubts- Koyomi's year-long life as a homeroom teacher-cum-"animal trainer" will begin!

Alcohol-loving Americans are chafing underneath the restrictions of Prohibition, but speakeasies have thankfully risen to fill the void with ill-begotten booze. The Blind Griffin is one such speakeasy in San Francisco, California, but it's about to go out of business...because its employees are a den of magicians who are more concerned with their magical studies and experiments than moonshine! Desperate not to lose the building that has become their haven, they hire the first streetsmart guttersnipe they find with some experience to help turn things around, but could she perhaps turn out to be the strongest magician of them all?、1.0、

Around the time the damages caused by the First Sino-Japanese War were beginning to heal, Mihagi Sonoo had graduated from a regular school. Unable to find employment, she found herself in poverty.		Then, an opportunity had arisen. Not far from her home was the Yokosuka Military Base, and they were looking to hire artists. Having learned of this, Sonoo headed for a job interview with the drawings she had made. However, while she was lost in the building, she accidentally witnessed the military band working as spies (they were in a meeting), and to top it off, she got caught doing so.		With the military band not wanting their secret to get leaked and with Sonoo looking for work, they came to an agreement: she became the military band's "artist-cum-spy apprentice" and became a member.		For a while, she was tasked with drawing posters and did some general work on the side. One day, her superior officer, Iyobe, summoned and ordered her to join the other band members to engage in actual spy missions.		And that was how the first mission of her life began.

It doesn't help that Monica, Lawrence's mother, is always trying to stick her nose in their lives. Amy thinks something bad happened to Lawrence when he was younger, and that affects his relationships.	* Hugh: Amy works with Hugh, but she feels that he doesn't respect her work.

The story takes place in a kingdom where slavery is legal. The wealthy nobles buy these slaves as jewels to embellish themselves with or as toys to fulfill their desires. Every person takes the law as a given, and accepts these actions as facts. That is why commoners work their very best to avoid lowering their positions to slaves. In such a scenario, you stand out as the odd one - you don’t treat slaves like slaves, you don’t stoop so low in front of your master either. And that is precisely why you will receive an extraordinary ending.

I was on my way to visit "The Mirror of the World" Exhibition.	Coincidentally, that day in the past, I was involved in a falling accident.	However, now that's just a childhood memory.		At the exhibition, I met 8 guys.	On that night... Tempted by the sweet aroma of the pomegranate which I so love, I ate it.	I was then suddenly struck by great sleepiness.	Unable to fight it off, I went to bed. It was then when I heard a sweet voice that made me shudder in disgust.		"Welcome home. Finally, I'm able to be in the same place as you."		When I shot up awake in the morning, I was holding a hand-mirror that I've never seen before.	A voice from the hand-mirror- calling itself the mirror's spirit- in a whisper, tells me to "save the fated one".	And then, I met the guys I first saw at the exhibition again.		When I drew closer to them, they invited me into the unreal and mad world; the "Mirror World".	The guys in the Mirror World will only call me "Snow White", and had crazed expressions unlike when they were in the real world.	I learned of the "Queen" as I became closer to them.		"Capture Snow White."		The Queen is trying to capture me- Snow White.	The guys' madness. The Queen drawing closer. I wonder why I'm called "Snow White", and why I’m being targeted...

In a forest close to the village where protagonist Lilia (name changeable) lived was an old witch who had aged a lot before becoming one.		That witch wanted a remedy that would restore her youth. One of the ingredients was a girl whose age was around that which the user wished to return to. The remedy gradually lost its effectiveness as time went by, taking around 10 years for its user to go back to normal.		In exchange for the witch to cast a spell that protected the protagonist's village from getting attacked by the forest's beasts, its residents offered the witch a suitably-aged girl every 10 years. However, the residents didn't want to escort the sacrificial girl all the way to the witch's house. Also, as the witch had poor legs, she didn't want to go to the village to pick up the sacrifice either.		So the residents lied to their sacrifice.		"There is an old lady who lives alone in the forest. She's sick, so go check on her."		Because the witch had poor eyesight, the residents garbed the sacrifice in eye-catching clothes and made her go to the witch's house alone. To hide the sacrifice's true purpose further, the residents never called her a "sacrifice". They named her after the clothing they garbed her in.		"Little Red Riding Hood".		Due to her stepmother's scheming, the protagonist was unfortunately selected as the "Little Red Riding Hood" of that year.		However, it wasn't the old witch that had awaited her. It was two wolves whom had eaten the witch and gained her magical power...		[Translation of DLSite Japan's story summary.]、1.0、

Born with the ability to see every person's red string of fate leading them to their soulmate, Valerie is tortured by the fact that her own string is either conveniently invisible to her or so faint that it can hardly be seen, which can only mean that her soulmate is on the opposite side of the Earth. Of course, Valerie chooses to believe in the latter.		Now starting her first year in university, Valerie is struggling to balance her studies and her multiple part time jobs to save up for the money to fund her travels to search for her soulmate. Even though she has no intention to meet anyone and fall in love, it seems like fate has other plans for her--and she might just meet someone who will make her question what she has always wanted and believed in.

It was the year when millions of players assumed the role of rookie cop-turned-secret agent Leon S. Kennedy as he traveled to rural Spain in pursuit of Ashley Graham, the president's missing daughter. A watershed moment in gaming, Resident Evil 4 was a reinvention of both its series and its genre - not to mention one hell of a party.		More importantly, Leon had amazing hair. Oh, and he flipped over lasers. For many, he entered the hallowed halls of video game heartthrobs in the same way he crashed through two-story windows: suddenly and with swag.		But we all know Leon's story. What about Ashley's? For the players of Resident Evil 4, she is, at best, an objective; at worst, a liability. A human cog in a well-oiled gameplay machine. But what if she was more than that? What if she was an interesting person, thrust into a crazy world with crazier men who run the gamut from hottie to hellspawn? How would she narrate this nightmare and who would she actually fall for?		Wonder no more. This is her story. This is Resident Evil 4: Otome Edition.		- Relive the events of Resident Evil 4, faithfully recreated from Ashley's perspective - and with exactly as much absurdity as that entails!		- Kindle your relationship with a host of eligible bachelors, including the stoic Leon, the mysterious Luis, the evasive Merchant, or perhaps even the conniving Lord Saddler!*		- Discover what happened to Ashley in the scenes you never saw, such as her initial kidnapping.		- Make fake decisions that reveal the illusory nature of choice!

There are many bad endings but they don't mean game over, in fact, the more endings you view, the more of the truth you will uncover! 		The game does not contain 18-rated material or sexual content, but it will include graphic descriptions of violence and some scenes of non-consensual kissing alongside some violent CGs.

The protagonist Narushima Ayako, raised in Asakusa, worked as a typist and lived with her father who ran a sweets shop.	On a weekend when her eldest brother was visiting after a long time, the family held a feast with sushi from a local shop, and enjoyed the evening among themselves.	All on a sudden, her father brought up something.		“A letter came for you from some unknown person.”		The letter from the unknown law firm that her father mentioned held grieveous content that she could have never imagined.		“This is Gamou Tatsuhiko from Shirobazu law firm.	As the executor appointed by the recently deceased millionaire Konuma Saburou, I would like to speak to you regarding the matters of succession of his	will.”	(What’s this……？ Things like inheritance of a millionaire sounds like something out of a romance novel.)		Although puzzled, Ayako agreed to hear out Mr. Gamou. After her second brother had also joined them at home, Mr. Gamou made a strange request to Ayako. He wished for her to be present at the reading of the will that would take place in near future and cooperate in its execution. 	Apparently any further details weren’t available until the will was opened. Ayako wasn’t even guaranteed to receive any inheritance. Such vague words filled Ayako with doubt and anxiousness.

Lacie comes from a world without colors, where fire is seen as the enemy and the mountains are a dangerous place, too far away from salt water. 	She is spirited away as a child after becoming the host of Ara, the Twin God.

However, despite the harmonious relationships of these kingdoms, a notorious phantom thief lurks around the whole country with a hidden identity, stealing the most revered artifacts, leaving no kingdom free from his hands. Gems, chests, crowns and scepters from the past generations, he leaves none of the precious artifacts behind. No one knows particularly why the phantom thief commits such crimes, as the stolen artifacts are nowhere to be seen. Recently, the phantom thief has sent a message for Ashwell Kingdom, declaring his plans of stealing a prized possession that they treasure.		While Ashwell is governed by matriarchy, Rose D'elaphontaine Ashwell, only child of the Ashwell family and next in line to the throne, seizes the opportunity to catch the infamous phantom thief and put a stop to his crimes, therefore deeming herself worthy of serving the kingdom in the eyes of her constituents as well as the Queen herself. For the past century, the Ashwells have governed their kingdom this way, with the Queen Regent as the Head of the Kingdom and the King as her General. However, Rose is clueless as to who and what the real phantom thief is capable of, and in her case, what she doesn't know can truly harm her.		As Rose gets closer to the truth, she comes to experience baffling emotions and these foreign feelings cause a stir inside of her. She comes across two dashing men with a recognizable social status and one who has always stood by her side. Because of the phantom thief, her life takes a major 180-degree turn, changing the princess who only knew of proper courtesy, political talks and marriage solely out of convenience. When she finds out the whole truth, will she go according to plan and ascend to the throne with flying colors, or will she risk everything in the name of love?

What if you were still the same gray figure the entire world saw you as?		What if you were just a bargaining chip in a game for depraved superhumans? A game with no rules. A game in which every mistake leads to an inevitable and cruel death. A game in which the correct path is not always obvious.		Only by straddling the line between evil and greater evil are you able to snatch your chance at survival.		But is it worth it..?		[From [url=https://namnorm.itch.io/degraman]itch.io[/url]]、1.0、

They were once known as Gods’ equal. However, because they pointed out God’s crimes against the people… They were massacred. Their existence, erased from all records. Banished to the bottom of the ocean.		Many thousands of years later saw some of the survivors fighting for a place amongst the humans; to survive. Evan: “I’ve already survived and gotten out of that place alive.” Osborn: “There’s no need for us to be ashamed of who we are and what we are by hiding within the human crowds.” Sariel: “All I wish for, is to bring her back to life.”		Their obsession with finding out the truth and reason behind it all, has become the strength they draw upon to continue surviving. Charlie: “A new world… I will be waiting for you here.” Jesse: “To return the truth back to history. That is my mission.”		The past gave them the strength to continue fighting; The fateful event from which everything began.

A mobile dating simulator with a conceptual plot, the player is both a painter and a person with the ability to travel through universes and go to and from parallel worlds.		The player plays the role of a freshman art student who’s just entered university, with one side of life being the warm daily activities of the real world’s campus, and the other side being inadvertently involved in the doomsday crisis of another world.		Parallel universes, similar faces, and different personalities. This proposition about “love and salvation” waits for players to paint their choices with their brushes.

Her village is too poor for alchemists or ishim to bother with, and monsters frequently threaten it. All she wants is to protect her village however she can.		Then an encounter with a mysterious alchemist leaves Yrsa bonded to an ishim of her own.  However, rather than being powerful or fierce, Uribel is a gentle pacifist, a water elemental with a love for all living creatures - and as a result is entirely useless to Yrsa, or so she thinks.		But as Uribel continues to aid her in his own way, could Yrsa eventually come to accept that there is more to strength than power, and more to love than the love she'd given up on?

The company her father runs goes bankrupt, and the family loses everything. 	But Kazusa has another huge problem--that they can no longer afford to pay her school fees.	"I worked so hard to get into Seiryou, so there's no way I'm going to transfer to a public school! If that's the case, I'll pay for the school fees myself!"	So declared Kazusa to her mother, but there's no way a pampered, naïve princess like herself could amass enough money without affecting her studies.	Just when she was about to give up.	"Well, I do have a solution...try asking for Miyake-senpai in class 3-A."	At her best friend and classmate Ayumi's suggestion, Kazusa seeks help from the third-year Miyake, and goes to meet him.	"There is one, ya know? A part-time job where you can earn quite the hefty sum while still leaving time to study, just for the girls of Seiryou."	"I'll do it! So please tell me more about that job!"	At her wits' end, Kazusa, in the heat of the moment, requested to have the job introduced to her.	When she went to find out more details, Miyake's classmate, a female student called Minakami was awaiting her.	"Our group, 'Club Camellia', provides a service wherein we introduce girls to our clients."	But isn't that kinda bad... isn't that what you call being an escort?	It does feel rather dangerous, but you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. Now that I've come this far, I've gotta stick it out!	"Understood. I'll become a member."	Though Kazusa was determined to do it for the sake of paying for her school fees, there was one thing that bothered her.		"Now that I think about it, I, well... haven't done it with a guy before, is that alright?"		"......"	"......"	"......"	An awkward silence ensued. The one who broke it was Minakami.	"Then, how about this. During the three days before your first job, you'll take some special lessons."	"Lessons?"	"You have to gain that experience within three days. ...Amongst those three guys, choose one of them to be your partner, alright?"	Those three men were also students in the same class 3-A as Minakami, and associates of 'Club Camellia': Miyake, Narusawa and Shindou.	Amongst those three who seem to have a quirk or two, Kazusa has to choose one of them to be her partner.	"I, I understand. I have no choice but to rely on this place, so... I'll be in your care!"		Everything is for the sake of a happy school life. And now, the three-day lessons begin.		[Translated from the [url=http://polish.sakura.ne.jp/kikaku2011.htm]official website[/url]]、1.0、

42926、The Shades of Red、2016-02-24、en、、、https://s2.vndb.org/cv/17/63917.jpg、This is a world in which status and occupation are all determined by the month of birth. At the eastern end of the country of Temirana, about fifteen years ago, a baby with a bruise on her forehead was born as the third princess. The baby was rumored to be a "cursed princess" and was forced to live separately from her family in a mansion away from the castle, but a big turning point came for her. 	[i]One day, my 16th birthday is just around the corner. At the venue of the duel tournament "Helis Duellum," I saw five men shining in a dazzlingly strong "light."[/i]		- Yes, this "cursed princess" had special luck. When her life is in danger, things and places shine as if to tell her to avoid them. Those around her who knew the princess's luck advised her that these men were dangerous people and that’s why they shone... but it was different from the light she had seen so far. Believing in her intuition, the princess decided to invite those who seemed to shine into her knighthood order. But some of them have no experience in swordplay, nor are they even interested in being knights. Will the princess be able to overcome the calamity that is about to occur with only a small group of five knights?		(From [url=https://www.otomate.jp/tsuitsui/story/]Official website[/url])、1.0、
